🔬 SLBS: Smart Laboratory Billing System

The Smart Laboratory Billing System (SLBS) is a comprehensive, web-based management solution designed specifically for small to medium-sized pathology laboratories. It streamlines patient registration, automated billing, test result entry, and ensures accurate financial and clinical reporting.

✨ Key Features💵 Billing and FinanceDynamic Billing: Quickly generate invoices based on selected tests.Flexible Payments: Supports multiple payment methods (Cash, Card, UPI) with real-time validation to ensure the total paid amount matches the net bill.Discounts: Allows application of discounts during the billing process.Print Preview: Provides instant, print-ready invoices upon successful submission.Cancellation & Reversal: Dedicated interface to cancel bills, automatically logging the reversal for financial reconciliation.

🧪 Laboratory ManagementTest Management (CRUD): Complete control over adding, editing, and deleting master test profiles.Nested Parameters: Supports defining complex tests with multiple sub-tests (parameters).Detailed Parameter Setup: Each test/sub-test can be configured with specific Specimen (e.g., Blood), Container (e.g., EDTA), TAT Time, and Unit (e.g., mg/dL, $\text{g}/\text{dL}$).Report Typing: Allows classifying parameters as Numeric (with customizable decimal precision) or Text to enforce data validation during entry.Reusable Data: Enables creation of new tests by selecting existing Department, Specimen, Container, and Unit entries.

📊 Reporting and Access ControlGranular Result Entry: Dedicated interface for lab technicians to input results, with fields dynamically rendered based on the tests billed to the patient.Abnormal Value Highlighting: Automatically bolds and colors results that fall outside the configured Reference Ranges (Normal Values).Reference Range Management: Allows setting multiple, age- and sex-specific normal ranges for every parameter (main test or sub-test).Print Options: Provides options for printing reports with or without the company letterhead (adding 2 inches of top margin for pre-printed paper).Patient History: Quick lookup tool to view a patient's entire billing history and check the report status (Pending/Ready) for each test.💻 Technical StackSLBS is built on a reliable, standard LAMP stack environment.ComponentTechnologyRoleBackend LogicPHP 7.4+ (Procedural)Handles all business logic, data processing, and security.DatabaseMySQL / MariaDBStores all patient, billing, test, and results data.Frontend/UIHTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript / jQueryProvides the user interface, dynamic form manipulation (AJAX search, dynamic payments), and input validation.DeploymentcPanel / Shared HostingStandard hosting environment compatibility.SecurityPrepared Statements (MySQLi)Used throughout the application to prevent SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks.

⚙️ Data Model StructureThe system relies on a linked data model to ensure data integrity (using Foreign Key constraints).Table NamePurposeKey RelationstestsMaster definitions for tests (Price, Unit, Report Type, Decimals).-sub_testsSpecific parameters nested under main tests (e.g., HB under CBC).test_id (FK)ref_rangesStores age/sex-specific normal values for parameters.test_id (FK), sub_test_id (FK, ON DELETE SET NULL)patientsPatient demographic data.-billingMaster invoice record (amounts, dates, status).pt_id (FK)bill_testsLinks tests to a specific invoice (tracks cost).bill_id, test_id (FKs)reportsStores finalized test results and the specific range used.bill_id, test_id, range_id (FKs, sub_test_id nullable)roles / permissions / role_permissionsDefines granular access levels (Superadmin, Admin, Receptionist, Accounts).-licenceStores the licence key and expiration date (enforced at login).-

🛡️ Security and Access ControlThe system implements strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):Authorization: Access to every page is controlled by the check_permission() function, verifying the user's role against required permissions (e.g., access_billing, manage_tests).Superadmin Bypass: The Superadmin (Role ID 1) is granted login access even if the main license key is expired, ensuring system administration can always be performed.Hierarchy Guardrail: Only the Superadmin can create or modify the Superadmin role's permissions.Database Security: All data submission and retrieval use MySQLi Prepared Statements to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
